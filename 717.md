### 1-bit and 2-bit Characters

We have two special characters:

    The first character can be represented by one bit 0.
    The second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11).

Given a binary array bits that ends with 0, return true if the last character must be a one-bit character.

 

## Example 1:

``` markdown

Input: bits = [1,0,0]
Output: true
Explanation: The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character.
So the last character is one-bit character.
```

## Example 2:

``` markdown

Input: bits = [1,1,1,0]
Output: false
Explanation: The only way to decode it is two-bit character and two-bit character.
So the last character is not one-bit character.
```
 

## Constraints:

    1 <= bits.length <= 1000
    bits[i] is either 0 or 1.

## Thought process

    - If we iterate through from left -> right
        - for each of the bit 'b' at index 'i'
            - if 'b' is equal to 1
                - it must be 2 bit
                    - then we can move to index 'i+2'
            - else 'b' is equal to 0
                - it must be 1 bit
                    - then we can move index 'i+1'
    - after performing the iterate
        - if our last index at the end of the array
            - then it must me a 1 bit 0

## Solutions

    - create a variable i to keep track of our current index.
    - while i is less than the last index ( bits.length-1 )
        - if bits[i] is equal to 1
            - set 'i' to 'i+2'
        - else 
            - set 'i' to 'i+1'
    - return true if 'i' is at the last index of bits
        - else reutn false

## Code

``` Java

    class Solution {
        public boolean isOneBitCharacter(int[] bits) {
            int i=0;
            while(i<bits.length-1){
                if(bits[i] == 1){
                    i = i+2;
                }
                else 
                    i = i+1;
            }
            return i == bits.length-1;
        }
    }

```
